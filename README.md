Supply Chain Logistics Problem Dataset

I found this dataset at [Brunel University London](https://brunel.figshare.com/articles/dataset/Supply_Chain_Logistics_Problem_Dataset/7558679). This repository contains the original dataset in its Excel format from Brunel University London, as well as a Python script that I wrote to split-up each of the worksheets in the Excel file into seperate CSV files.
